    Inspired from the Google sample on card flipping.
    This object animator is used as a custom fragment transition. See
    FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimation for more details.

    The overall effect of this animator is to rotate the front of the card
    out of view. The order of operations is described below:

    1. The front rotates 90 degrees, from facing the user to being
       zero-width, fully perpendicular to the viewer, facing left.
    2. The front rotates (instantly) another 180 degrees, so we have 90 degrees left for a complete rotation.

    At the end of this animation we should make the card view look like the back of our card.
    Then a second animation will complete the flip.

    We could use only one animation but splitting them allows setting a listener for the end of this one.
